Given an array of n integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. 
There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

Each student gets one packet.
The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

Input : arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12} , m = 5 
Output: Minimum Difference is 6 
Explanation:
The set goes like 3,4,7,9,9 and the output 
is 9-3 = 6  

#Code 

def solve(lst,m):
    n=len(lst)
    if n==0 or m==0:
        return 0 
    if n<m:
        return -1 
    lst.sort()
    ans=lst[n-1]-lst[0]
    for i in range(n-m+1):
        ans=min(ans,lst[i+m-1]-lst[i])
    return ans

lst=[12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41,30, 40, 28, 42, 30, 44, 48,43, 50]
m=7
print(solve(lst,m))

output=10
