You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

#Code 

import sys
def solve(prices):
    max_profit=0
    max_price=sys.maxsize 
    for x in prices:
        if x<max_price:
            max_price=x 
        else:
            max_profit=max(max_profit,x-max_price)
    return max_profit

prices =[7,6,4,3,1]
print(solve(prices))

output=5
