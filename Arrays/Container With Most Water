You are given an integer array height of length n. 
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

#Code 

def solve(height):
    low=0
    high=len(height)-1 
    max_area=-1 
    while low<high:
        curr_area=min(height[low],height[high])*(high-low)
        if curr_area>max_area:
            max_area=curr_area 
        if height[low]<height[high]:
            low+=1 
        else:
            high-=1 
    return max_area

height=[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
print(solve(height)) 

output=49
