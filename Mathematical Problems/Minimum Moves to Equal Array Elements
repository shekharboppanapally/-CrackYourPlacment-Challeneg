Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.
In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

#Code 

def minimumMoves(nums):
    ans=min(nums)
    res=0
    for x in nums:
        res+=(x-ans)
    return res
nums=[1,1,1]
print(minimumMoves(nums))

output=0
