Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

#Code 

def missingNumber(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)+1):
        if i not in nums:
            return i


nums=[9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
print(missingNumber(nums))

output=8
