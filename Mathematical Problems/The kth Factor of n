You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, 
return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

#Code 

def solve(N,K):
    lst=[]
    for i in range(1,int(N//2)+1):
        if N%i==0:
            lst.append(i)
    lst.append(N)
    if len(lst)<K:
        return -1 
    else:
        return lst[K-1]

N=24
K=6
print(solve(N,K))

output=8
